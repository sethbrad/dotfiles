Where I put my Linux config stuff

WIP:

* Need to set up scripting automation
* Alacritty and Picom are not condensed
* See about changin the names of the symlinks
* Fix syntax highlighting in Vim? It's not picking up the extensions
* Quick access from dmenu? That would be nice
* Complete my rice with Endeavour stuff and maybe polybar
